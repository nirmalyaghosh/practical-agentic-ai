Review the discovered items provided in context\n2. For EACH item, call classify_item (this tool uses pattern matching)\n3. Optionally call check_git_status, query_similar_decisions, or check_dependencies for additional context\n4. After processing ALL items, call finish\n\nRemember: You're coordinating tool execution, not reasoning about safety yourself."
